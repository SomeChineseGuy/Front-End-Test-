#### Features
- Drag and drop section
- Input fields for Strings and Numbers
- Dropdown for inputs that require it
- Submission check, so if a field is require the form will not submit.
- There are 2 sets of data in the data folder make sure your form is compatible with both.

#### Submitting the Form
If all the required items are filled out in the form, make a `POST` request to `https://localhost:3000/api/form`. This will return an error but we just want to see the API submission code as part of your final product. Send over the same `API` data that you were but with the inputted data and updated drag and drop position.
